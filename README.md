# Female-Faces---Image-Dataset
# 📷 Female Faces - Image Dataset

Welcome to the **Female Faces - Image Dataset** repository! This dataset contains a collection of labeled images of female faces, useful for research in facial recognition, biometric analysis, and AI-driven image processing applications.

## 📌 Dataset Overview
- 🏷 **Diverse Representations:** Includes various ethnicities, ages, and facial expressions  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Applications:** Ideal for training AI models in facial recognition  
- 🎭 **Emotion Analysis:** Supports studies in facial expression classification  
- 🌍 **Dataset Diversity:** Ensures a balanced representation across demographic groups  

## 📂 Data Format
The dataset consists of structured image files with key attributes:
- `Image ID` – Unique identifier for each image  
- `Age Group` – Categorization (Young, Adult, Senior)  
- `Ethnicity` – Broad classification based on visual traits  
- `Facial Expression` – Labeling (Neutral, Smiling, Surprised, etc.)  
- `Resolution` – Image quality and pixel dimensions  
- `Dataset Split` – Training, Validation, Test subsets  

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository to start working with the image dataset:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Female-Faces-Image-Dataset.git
cd Female-Faces-Image-Dataset


Load and visualize dataset samples in Python:
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

image = cv2.imread("images/sample_face.jpg")
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.show()
